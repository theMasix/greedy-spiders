# Greedy Spiders

A Web Game inspired by the android game [Greedy Spiders](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blyts.greedyspiders2.free), but in JavaScript.

It's built on top of the [Force Directed Graph Editor](http://bl.ocks.org/benzguo/4362310). Thanks to [Ben Guo](https://github.com/benzguo)

## Motivations

It's my end-of-semester project of university Computer Basics class. Hope you Enjoy!

### TODO

- [ ] Logic of the computer play strategy should be added to README file.
- [ ] Structure of inputs (Maps) should be added to README file.
- [ ] It needs some UX improvements. so users will know how to start the game.
- [ ] Also code structure should be improved and `process.js` should be splitted in multiple files.
